What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first I was adding the print statements into the different methods in the computer class but for some of the methods it wouldn't make sense for the computer itself to print the error message. I figured out those print statements had to either be added in the oo_resale_shop or in the main. Advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to look at the procedural code provided and break it up into different classes before then dividing the methods into the appropriate classes. Trying to figure it all out in one go can be more confusing so it is good to start smaller.
